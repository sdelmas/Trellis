## Session 1: Runtime hardening audit implemented in four slices

**Date**: 2026-08-09
**Task**: Runtime hardening audit implemented in four slices
**Package**: cli
**Branch**: `chore/task-backlog-2026-08`

### Summary

Housekeeping: renamed branch to chore/task-backlog-2026-08, applied trellis update 0.6.14, reset local main and fork main to origin/main, pinned trellis-implement/research agents to opus (dogfood + template). Landed cheap wins: bundled-skill trailing-whitespace cleanup with repo-wide markdown scan test, break-loop artifact existence guard with render/mirror parity tests; archived both tasks. Executed 07-08-runtime-hardening-audit end to end: audit matrix, then path containment chokepoint in resolve_task_dir, create/archive/link collision safety with --force, JSON read/write failure surfacing with strict/tolerant split, hook timeout + diagnostics, config parser consolidation. 1709 tests green, lint/typecheck clean, both script trees byte-identical. Note: pre-commit suite runs against dist/, run pnpm build after editing template scripts.

## Session 2: Backlog sweep: verified upstream-covered tasks, landed three CLI hardening features

**Date**: 2026-08-09
**Task**: Backlog sweep: verified upstream-covered tasks, landed three CLI hardening features
**Package**: cli
**Branch**: `chore/task-backlog-2026-08`

### Summary

Verified 08-06-converge-platform-templates fully covered by upstream 6ddd9412 and archived it; verified all in-repo acceptance criteria of 08-06-adopt-trellis-finish-clear-fix (fix present at active_task.py:695, E2E fallback-clear proven in temp repo, no local orphans) leaving only cross-repo consumer rollout. Implemented and archived three tasks: create-empty-metadata-rejection (validation before any filesystem write, explicit whitespace predicate covering U+FEFF/U+0085), archive-index-lock-retry (bounded backoff on transient index.lock, moved-with-pending-commit abort design naming the lock), task.py rename (atomic identity+back-reference rewrite, dry-run/apply from one plan structure). All via trellis-implement/check agent loop with independent probes. Per user instruction: taosu-owned upstream tasks excluded from backlog work. Remaining owned backlog: developer-worktree-provisioning, validate-task-branch-metadata-before-archive, align-task-validation-preflight, add-session retry, OpenCode mem reader.

## Session 3: Backlog batch: validation preflight, add_session state machine, OpenCode mem reader
<!-- trellis-session: fp=498f88303810ef61 -->

**Date**: 2026-08-09
**Task**: Backlog batch: validation preflight, add_session state machine, OpenCode mem reader
**Package**: cli
**Branch**: `chore/task-backlog-2026-08`

### Summary

Landed five features on chore/task-backlog-2026-08 and archived their tasks: branch-at-start recording with archive-time metadata validation, worktree developer identity, empty context manifests with _example rejection aligned to PR preflight, add_session rewritten as a resumable state machine with real commit subjects and collision-proof numbering, and the OpenCode mem reader restored on the zero-dependency SQLite parser. Marketplace and docs-site submodules synced on local branches (no push access upstream).

### Main Changes

- task.py start records the checked-out branch; archive validates branch metadata
- developer.py resolves identity in linked worktrees via git-common-dir inheritance
- task creation writes empty implement/check.jsonl; validate rejects legacy _example rows and non-object rows; list-context guarded
- add_session.py: preflight OID-to-subject resolution, fingerprint markers, journal/index/commit retry convergence, ref-union session numbering, write_text_atomic
- OpenCode mem adapter on sqlite-readonly.ts: XDG/OPENCODE_DB paths, name-matched schema validation, three structured warning codes, store-leak fix in sessions.ts

### Git Commits

| Hash | Message |
|------|---------|
| `adb7acfb` | feat(mem): restore install-safe OpenCode session reader |

### Testing

- [OK] CLI suite 1773 passed (73 files); core 368 passed, 1 skipped; hostile probes in temp repos for every feature; live dogfood: 6 OpenCode sessions listed, db bytes unchanged

### Status

[OK] **Completed**

### Next Steps

- Push submodule branches once forks exist; consumer rollout for finish-clear fix via sd-status fleet; upstream PR from fork branch


## Session 4: PR 534 review convergence
<!-- trellis-session: fp=734118e44a93414b -->

**Date**: 2026-08-09
**Task**: PR 534 review convergence
**Package**: cli
**Branch**: `chore/task-backlog-2026-08`

### Summary

Converged the Copilot + CodeRabbit review loop on PR 534: verified every
finding against the code, fixed the confirmed ones, rebutted the rest.

### Main Changes

- Fixed 9 bot review findings: journal MULTILINE regex, convergence ref cap local-head exemption, developer-name traversal + Windows drive letters, rename session repoint, OPENCODE_DB tilde expansion, config list-mapping rejection, toIso range guard, stale-index test precondition
- Rebutted archived-artifact edits, start-gate enforcement, repoint failure-contract comments with verified reasoning
- Filed follow-up task 08-09-hook-timeout-process-tree; documented marketplace submodule CI gap on PR with ready-to-apply git-am patch

### Git Commits

- `b21a6675` fix: address PR 534 review findings from Copilot and CodeRabbit (7 findings)
- `5a9f5f9a` fix: reject drive-letter developer names; assert stale-index precondition (incremental round)
- `155c790d` chore(task): file follow-up for hook timeout process-tree kill (PR 534)

### Testing

- [OK] Full CLI suite 1777 passed; core 369 passed; script trees byte parity

### Status

[OK] **Completed**

### Next Steps

- Plan and implement hook-timeout process-tree kill task


## Session 5: Retire the platypeeps Trellis mirror onto the sdelmas fork
<!-- trellis-session: v=2 fp=980d83a07f66af9d -->

**Date**: 2026-08-25
**Task**: Retire the platypeeps Trellis mirror onto the sdelmas fork
**Package**: cli
**Branch**: `main`

### Summary

Repointed ai/Trellis's fork remote from the platypeeps/Trellis mirror to sdelmas/Trellis, the real fork of mindfold-ai/Trellis. The mirror held nothing unique except the dependabot undici 6.23.0->6.28.0 branch, carried over and merged as #7 (5042dd9f); every other branch SHA already matched and sdelmas carried 132 tags to the mirror's zero. Archived platypeeps/Trellis read-only. origin push stays DISABLED, so nothing reaches mindfold-ai. marketplace submodule already pointed at sdelmas/marketplace.

## Session 6: Resplit upstream PR #534 into five PRs
<!-- trellis-session: v=2 fp=f819f07e78dadf6b -->

**Date**: 2026-08-25
**Task**: Resplit upstream PR #534 into five PRs
**Package**: cli
**Branch**: `main`

### Summary

Closed mindfold-ai/Trellis#534 and reopened it as five scoped PRs per the maintainer's spec: #574 OpenCode mem reader, #575 update receipt repair, #576 runtime hardening, #577 add_session state machine, #578 task lifecycle (stacked on #576, since 00ae5af4 needs six helpers that land in C). Slice E's workflow.md hunks were deferred to mindfold-ai/marketplace#17 because the pinned marketplace commit 7310a50c is an orphan off d286b2c and not an ancestor of marketplace main, so the mirror assertion cannot be satisfied by a pointer bump. All slices build and test green.
